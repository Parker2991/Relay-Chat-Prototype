Chess is a game played on an 8x8 checkered board, called a chessboard. To play chess, you move your pieces on the board. The goal is to checkmate the other player's king. You need to do it with your pieces.
  Rooks: horizontal and vertical
  Knights (horses): L shape (one square horizontal, two vertical) or (two squares horizontal, one vertical). Only piece that can jump over others.
  Bishops: diagonal
  Queens: Rook or bishop only
  King: one square anywhere (not into check)
  Pawns: one square, first move two squares, captures diagonally

  Promotion: When pawns reach the last rank, they can promote to any piece other than pawn and kings. 
  Castling: Move your king 2 squares towards the rook and move the rook next to the king on the other side. Neither should have moved in the game and the king can't be in check or go through it.
  En Passant: When your pawn is on the 5th rank away from your back rank and a pawn moves 2 forward and lands next to yours, you may capture the pawn like it only moved 1 square. It can only be done on the very next move.

  

  Check: The king is under attack from one of the opponents pieces, and he must move out of check on the next move. The king never gets captured.
  Checkmate: The king is in check and can't escape. It results in a win for the checkmating player.
  Stalemate: The king can't move except into check. It results in a draw.

  Board Setup: The board is oriented so that there is a light square in the bottom right corner of both players. The rooks go on the corners, then the knights go next to them, then the bishops, then the queen and king. The queen always goes on her own color. On the next row up the pawns go on every square.
  White always makes the first move.
